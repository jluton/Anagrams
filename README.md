## Anagrams

#Assumptions
1. We want our output to print to the console. Other options would be to write the output to a new
   .txt file using fs.writefile(), or to output the results as an object or array.
2. Our anagram-printing function will operate by taking in the filepath to a local .txt file that     contains the words for which we will find anagrams.
